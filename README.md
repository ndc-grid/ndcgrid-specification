# The NDCGRID Specification

The NDCGRID Specification is an open specification that relies on the IATA NDC schemas standard, which is used by the airline industry for NDC APIs.

The NDCGRID Specification is a standard interface description for NDC APIs independent of programming languages.

Its purpose is to enable humans and computers to discover and comprehend the capabilities of an NDC API without requiring access to source code, additional documentation, or inspection of network traffic.

A consumer can understand and interact with minimal implementation logic when adequately defined. The NDCGRID Specification is similar to interface descriptions used in lower-level programming (e.g. OpenAPI/Swagger), as it eliminates the guesswork in calling an NDC API workflow.

Machine-readable NDC API definition documents have several use cases, including interactive documentation, code generation for documentation, clients, and servers, and the automation of test cases.

NDCGRID specification documents describe NDC API services and flows using YAML or JSON formats. These documents can be produced and served statically or generated dynamically from an application.

The NDCGRID Specification does not mandate the rewriting of existing NDC APIs. Additionally, it does not require any software to be bound to a service, regardless of whether the creator of the service's description owns it.

However, it is necessary to describe the NDC API flows using the NDCGRID Specification. The NDCGRID Specification also does not impose any specific development process, such as design-first or code-first. However, it does facilitate either technique by establishing precise interactions with an NDC API.

This GitHub project is the starting point for NDCGRID specification. Here, you will find the information you need about the NDCGRID Specification, simple examples of what it looks like, and some general information regarding the project.
